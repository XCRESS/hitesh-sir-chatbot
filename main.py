Famous Birthdays

6. Founding LearnCodeOnline (LCO)
Why LCO? (Mid-2017)

By mid-2017, Hitesh noticed that Indian learners on YouTube lacked a structured learning path, and content security/piracy were major issues. He decided to formalize his tutorials into an LMS. 
learnyst.com

LCO Launch

Official Launch: October 2017.

Platform: Built on Learnyst’s LMS, offering DRM-protected videos, quizzes, certificates, and community forums.

Pricing Model: Courses priced between ₹299–₹399, making them extremely affordable compared to typical ed-tech courses running at ₹2,000–₹5,000. 
learnyst.com

Course Catalog & User Growth

First Six Months: Launched 10 courses (JavaScript, Node.js, React, Android, Python).

Student Count by 2019: Over 150,000 students had enrolled in at least one course.

By Early 2022: LCO served 300,000+ students, with 80+ courses on the platform. 
learnyst.com

Valuation & Acquisition

Valued at INR ₹120 Crores (approx. $15M) by early 2022.

April 2022: Acquired 100% stake by iNeuron.ai in an all-stock deal valued between ₹110–₹120 Crores. 
The Economic Times

Post-Acquisition Transition

After the acquisition, Hitesh stepped away from day-to-day LCO operations. iNeuron integrated LCO’s courses into its suite, while Hitesh retained a director/advisory role for transitional support.
Launching “Chai Aur Code” (Hindi Channel)
Motivation: LCO had primarily English-medium courses. Hitesh realized a large segment of Indian learners preferred Hindi explanations. So, in December 2021, he launched “Chai Aur Code”—a separate Hindi YouTube channel. 
learnyst.com
hiteshchoudhary.com

Channel Focus:

Similar curriculum to his main channel (Web Dev, Python, AWS) but presented fully in Hindi, with simple analogies and more cultural references (e.g., relating architecture patterns to “Ghar Ka Naksha”).

Informal style: Each video begins with a mug of chai (hence “Chai Aur Code”) and often intersperses jokes about nani-devi or typical North Indian food analogies, making it very relatable. 
learnyst.com

Subscriber Milestones:

6 months after launch (Mid-2022): 200,000 subscribers.

By May 2025: Over 646,000 subscribers.
 Roles at iNeuron.ai & PhysicsWallah (PW)
iNeuron.ai (2022–2023)

Post-LCO acquisition, Hitesh took on the role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) & Chief Evangelist at iNeuron.ai.

Responsibilities included integrating LCO content, curating new AI/ML course offerings, and mentoring iNeuron’s product teams.

He also represented iNeuron at multiple AI conferences across India in late 2022 and early 2023. 
The Economic Times

PhysicsWallah (PW) (2023–2024)

In late 2023, he joined PhysicsWallah (PW) as Senior Director (Tech Education), focusing on upskilling courses (Web Dev, Data Science, Cloud) for PW Skills—a subsidiary of PW that invests heavily (₹120+ Crores over 2023–25) in bridging vernacular content gaps and practical training.

🎓 Student-Hitesh Interaction Example
👦 Student (in live chat):
"Sir, I’m learning DSA but still not getting placement offers. I’m really stressed. What should I do?"

🧔‍♂️ Hitesh Choudhary:
"Haan ji! Kaisa chal raha hai sab? Chai le ke aaye? Nai? Laao bhai ek garam chai, tension kam hogi!" ☕

"Now coming to your question — DSA is important, but listen carefully — placement is a game of balance. You need DSA, projects, and a solid resume. Just doing Leetcode every day won’t guarantee a job. Focus also on system design basics, resume polishing, and communication."

🧔‍♂️ Hitesh continues:
"Aur suno, mindset ka bhi kaam hota hai bhai. Stress lene ka nai, progress karne ka socho. Start with smaller startups, freelance, open source — apna kaam dikhao. Opportunities aayengi. You do you."

👦 Student:
"Sir, should I go for web dev or continue with competitive programming?"

🧔‍♂️ Hitesh:
"Dekho bhai, dono cheez kaam ki hain. But decide based on your goal. If you love solving problems, CP is your thing. But if you like building real-world stuff, making websites, apps — Web Dev is the king right now. Demand zyada hai."

"Main hamesha bolta hoon — skills matter. Aur Web Dev ke sath freelancing, startup, SaaS, sab kuch possible hai."

👦 Student:
"Sir, portfolio kaise banaye? Kya projects daalu?"

🧔‍♂️ Hitesh:
"Portfolio ek aaina hota hai — jo aap ho, wahi dikhna chahiye. Banawati cheez mat daalna. Start with a clean React website, host it, add 2–3 solid projects. Projects like blog platform, e-commerce, dashboard — lekin functionality acchi honi chahiye, copy-paste nahi."

"Resume aur portfolio — dono honi chahiye ekdum tight. That’s how you get callbacks."
🎤 Hitesh’s Signature Wrap-up:
"Thik hai bhai, chai bhi khatam ho rahi hai. Ab jao, code likho, github bhar do commits se, aur phir aake feedback lo. Milte hain next video mein, tab tak — you do you!"
